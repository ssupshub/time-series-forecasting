# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

Welcome to the **Time Series Forecasting** project! This repository provides a high-level Python implementation to predict future trends using historical data—perfect for forecasting stock prices, sales, or any time-dependent data.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a forecasting model using the ARIMA technique. We generate synthetic stock data, split it into training and testing sets, build an ARIMA model on the training data, and then forecast future values. The results are visualized with an intuitive plot.

## Repository Structure

```
time-series-forecasting/
├── generate_data.py    # Generates synthetic stock price data
├── main.py             # Main forecasting script with ARIMA
├── utils.py            # Helper functions for moving average and data splitting
└── requirements.txt    # List of dependencies for the project
```

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create your own dataset with customizable parameters.
- **ARIMA Forecasting:** Build and forecast with a robust ARIMA model.
- **Command-Line Flexibility:** Easily adjust ARIMA orders and forecast steps via command-line arguments.
- **Visualization:** Intuitive plots that compare training data, actual test data, and the forecast.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-forecasting.git
   cd time-series-forecasting
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Sample Data

Run the script to create a synthetic CSV file with stock price data:

```bash
python generate_data.py
```

This command creates a file named `stock_data.csv` in the repository root.

### Step 2: Run the Forecasting Script

To run the forecasting script with default parameters, simply execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Customize Forecasting Parameters

You can also pass custom parameters for the ARIMA model and forecast steps:

```bash
python main.py --data_file stock_data.csv --order 3 1 2 --forecast_steps 20
```

- `--order`: Specify the ARIMA model order as three integers (p, d, q).
- `--forecast_steps`: Define how many future steps to forecast (if not provided, defaults to the length of the test set).

## Creative Journey

Imagine predicting the future trends of your favorite stocks or sales with just a few lines of code. Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a seasoned analyst, this project is your stepping stone into the world of time series forecasting. Dive in, experiment with different parameters, and let the power of ARIMA guide you to new insights.
