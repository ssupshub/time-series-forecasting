## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a forecasting model using the **ARIMA** technique. We generate synthetic stock data, split it into training and testing sets, build an ARIMA model on the training data, and then forecast future values. The results are visualized with an intuitive plot, making it easy to see how the model performs against real data.

## Repository Structure

```
time-series-forecasting/
├── generate_data.py    # Generates synthetic stock price data
├── main.py             # Main forecasting script with ARIMA
├── utils.py            # Helper functions for data splitting and more
└── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
```

- **generate_data.py**: Creates a CSV file containing synthetic stock price data.  
- **main.py**: Main script that loads data, trains an ARIMA model, and plots results.  
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for data manipulation (e.g., train-test split).  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python libraries required to run this project.

---

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**  
  Quickly create a customizable dataset for testing and experimentation.

- **ARIMA Forecasting**  
  Build a robust ARIMA model to forecast future values with minimal setup.

- **Command-Line Flexibility**  
  Easily adjust ARIMA orders and forecast steps via command-line arguments.

- **Visualization**  
  Generate intuitive plots that compare training data, test data, and the forecast.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-forecasting.git
   cd time-series-forecasting
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source env/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Generate Sample Data

Use the following command to create a synthetic CSV file with stock price data:

```bash
python generate_data.py
```

This command generates a file named `stock_data.csv` in the repository root.

### Run the Forecasting Script

To run the forecasting script with default parameters:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a matplotlib window displaying the training data, test data, and forecasted values.

### Customize Forecasting Parameters

You can pass custom parameters for the ARIMA model order and forecast steps:

```bash
python main.py --data_file stock_data.csv --order 3 1 2 --forecast_steps 20
```

- **`--data_file`**: Path to the CSV file (defaults to `stock_data.csv`).  
- **`--order`**: ARIMA model order as three integers `(p d q)`.  
- **`--forecast_steps`**: Number of future steps to forecast (defaults to the test set size).
